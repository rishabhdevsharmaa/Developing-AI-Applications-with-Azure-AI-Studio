# Developing AI Applications with Microsoft Foundry: Evaluation Flow Setup

## Overall Estimated Duration: 1 Hour

## Overview 

This lab is intended for AI developers, data scientists, cloud engineers, and AI enthusiasts aiming to gain hands-on experience in building and evaluating AI workflows using Microsoft Foundry's Prompt Flow. Participants will learn to initialize Prompt Flow projects, create and customize prompts, and develop flows using LLM and Prompt tools. They will also set up both automated and manual evaluation pipelines using built-in metrics and human feedback. The lab emphasizes a structured approach to designing, testing, and refining prompt-based AI applications for improved performance and reliability.

## Objectives 

By completing this lab, participants will learn to evaluate model performance using built-in metrics like accuracy and F1-score, and enhance results through human-in-the-loop feedback.

- **Initialize a Prompt Flow Project**: ou will learn how to set up a structured Prompt Flow project in Microsoft Foundry by creating a project directory, configuring essential files, and organizing resources to streamline the design, testing, and refinement of prompt-based AI workflows.

- **Create and Customize Prompts**: You will learn how to design and tailor prompts to guide LLMs effectively, aligning them with specific objectives and use cases to enhance the accuracy, relevance, and impact of AI-generated responses.

- **Develop a Flow with LLM and Prompt Tools**: You will learn how to build a flow using LLM and Prompt tools by defining objectives, crafting and refining prompts, and leveraging model outputs to create effective, task-specific AI workflows.

- **Set Up Evaluation Metrics**: You will learn how to define evaluation criteria, collect human feedback, and analyze model outputs to assess performance, accuracy, and potential biases through a manual evaluation process.

- **Set Up Automated Evaluation with Built-in Metrics**: You will learn how to configure automated evaluation using built-in metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to efficiently measure and monitor model performance.

## Prerequisites 

Participants should have: 
Basic knowledge and understanding of the following
 
 - Azure Portal
 - Microsoft Foundry

## Architecture 

- **Azure Portal** : The Azure Portal is a unified web-based console that provides a comprehensive interface for managing Azure resources. It allows users to build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud applications.
- **Microsoft Foundry** : Microsoft Foundry is a development environment for building, training, and deploying AI models. It provides tools and services to streamline the AI development lifecycle, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
